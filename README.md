Fitness Challenge App

I am thinking of creating a fitness challenge app. One method that may help individual keep on track and motivate them to go to the active or go to gym is competition. A group of people, such as friends or teammates, can push each other to be their best. The proposed Fitness Challenge app will help promote healthy competition and encourage users to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The essential idea behind the application is assigning a point value to different fitness activities, recording the activity of the competitors, and tallying the point total for each individual. For example, running for 30 minutes could earn a participant 30 points. Users will be able to track their progress compared to their friends in a “club leaderboard”.
Essential features are:
•	Ability to enter completed workout information simply and quickly
•	Ability to edit/delete past workout
•	User created “clubs” that allow friends to form a group
•	Leaderboard to display user points table
My first minimum viable product(MVP) would be the app functionality working for single user and then expand to work for multiple users.
